### About Shoreline
The Shoreline platform provides real-time monitoring, alerting, and incident automation for cloud operations. Use Shoreline to detect, debug, and automate repairs across your entire fleet in seconds with just a few lines of code.

Shoreline Agents are efficient and non-intrusive processes running in the background of all your monitored hosts. Agents act as the secure link between Shoreline and your environment's Resources, providing real-time monitoring and metric collection across your fleet. Agents can execute actions on your behalf -- everything from simple Linux commands to full remediation playbooks -- running simultaneously across all the targeted Resources.

Since Agents are distributed throughout your fleet and monitor your Resources in real time, when an issue occurs Shoreline automatically alerts your team before your operators notice something is wrong. Plus, when you're ready for it, Shoreline can automatically resolve these issues using Alarms, Actions, Bots, and other Shoreline tools that you configure. These objects work in tandem to monitor your fleet and dispatch the appropriate response if something goes wrong -- you can even receive notifications via the fully-customizable Slack integration.

Shoreline Notebooks let you convert your static runbooks into interactive, annotated, sharable web-based documents. Through a combination of Markdown-based notes and Shoreline's expressive Op language, you have one-click access to real-time, per-second debug data and powerful, fleetwide repair commands.

### What are Shoreline Op Packs?
Shoreline Op Packs are open-source collections of Terraform configurations and supporting scripts that use the Shoreline Terraform Provider and the Shoreline Platform to create turnkey incident automations for common operational issues. Each Op Pack comes with smart defaults and works out of the box with minimal setup, while also providing you and your team with the flexibility to customize, automate, codify, and commit your own Op Pack configurations.

# Spark Task Deserialization Failures
---

This incident type refers to instances where Spark tasks are failing due to deserialization errors. This can occur when the serialized data does not match the expected format, causing the task to fail. Deserialization errors can be challenging to handle, and require careful consideration to ensure that the root cause is identified and addressed appropriately.

### Parameters
```shell
export SPARK_LOG_FILE="PLACEHOLDER"

export SPARK_PID="PLACEHOLDER"

export PATH_TO_CLASS_FILES="PLACEHOLDER"

export CLASS_NAME="PLACEHOLDER"

export SERIALIZED_DATA_FILE="PLACEHOLDER"

export SPARK_VERSION="PLACEHOLDER"

export NEW_DESERIALIZATION_LIBRARY="PLACEHOLDER"
```

## Debug

### Check Spark logs for deserialization errors
```shell
grep "java.io.InvalidClassException" ${SPARK_LOG_FILE}
```

### Check which classes are being deserialized when the error occurs
```shell
jstack ${SPARK_PID} | grep "java.io.ObjectInputStream.readClassDescriptor"
```

### Check if the serialized data matches the expected class
```shell
javap -cp ${PATH_TO_CLASS_FILES} -verbose ${CLASS_NAME} | grep "minor version"
```

### Check if the serialized data is corrupted
```shell
xxd ${SERIALIZED_DATA_FILE} | head
```

### Incompatibility between the Spark version and the serialization/deserialization library used for the job.
```shell


#!/bin/bash



# Step 1: Check the version of Spark being used

spark_version=$(<path/to/spark/bin/spark-submit --version | head -n 1)



echo "Spark Version: $spark_version"



# Step 2: Check the version of the serialization/deserialization library being used

deser_version=$(<path/to/serialization/deserialization/library/version | head -n 1)



echo "Deserialization Library Version: $deser_version"



# Step 3: Compare the two versions to check for compatibility

if [ "$spark_version" == "$deser_version" ]; then

  echo "Spark and Deserialization Library versions are compatible."

else

  echo "Spark and Deserialization Library versions are incompatible. Please update the library version."

fi


```

## Repair

### Update the deserialization library to one that's compatible with the Spark version
```shell


#!/bin/bash



# Set variables

SPARK_VERSION=${SPARK_VERSION}

DESERIALIZATION_LIBRARY=${NEW_DESERIALIZATION_LIBRARY}



# Stop Spark services

sudo systemctl stop spark-master.service

sudo systemctl stop spark-worker.service



# Install new deserialization library

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install $DESERIALIZATION_LIBRARY



# Update Spark configuration with new deserialization library

sudo sed -i "s#spark.serializer=.*#spark.serializer=org.apache.spark.serializer.KryoSerializer#g" /opt/spark/conf/spark-defaults.conf

sudo sed -i "s#spark.kryo.registrator=.*#spark.kryo.registrator=com.example.MyKryoRegistrator#g" /opt/spark/conf/spark-defaults.conf



# Start Spark services

sudo systemctl start spark-worker.service

sudo systemctl start spark-master.service
